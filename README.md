groovy-integration-patterns
===========================

This is the code used for the Groovy Integration Patterns. It shows that you can use Groovy to add Java classes into a Java framework (a contrived one here that does CLI work) and it shows that you can indeed monkey patch between Groovy and Java. Unit tests demonstrate how to do some interesting Monkey patching between Groovy and Java as well as how to create a Groovy "synthetic class" at load time doing some magic with the Groovy Class Loader ... and much of this works back in Java land as well.
